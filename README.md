# pick-tea-maker

This is a tool to help fairly distribute the tea making duties in a team. It is built using Vue 3 and Vite and utilises Pinia for state management. The tool is styled using Tailwind CSS.

To use the tool enter the names of all team members that are involved in the consuming of tea. Once you have uploaded all names just click on the 'Pick Tea Maker' button and you will see a notification telling you whose turn it is to make the tea for everyone. You can use the 'Reset Tea Rounds' button to reset the count for each user if more people join the rounds or to start fresh for a new work day.
